# Cookie-Clicker-Buffs
Small, non-coding based Repository for all your cookie clicker needs. 
The initial idea of this Repository is for bored Cookie Clicker players looking for hacks and such.
We **are not** responsible for anything that happens to your save, or your computer.
It will be your responsibility to back up your save in any way.
If your file gets corrupted, or anything else, **We are NOT liable.**
Every save is **hacked**, and not authentic. So we aren't enslaving people to get these saves this far in under 24 hours.
Or are we...

Reminder, we **ARE** trying to ruin the game. And we **DO NOT** have some useless excuse for hacking it.
Of course, Orteil fully condones hacking, and has added two **shadow achievements** for hackers exclusively. 

**Dungeon Achievements** are unavailable, so if a save has them, **it is hacked**
And obviously the **shadow achievement**, known as **Cheated Cookies Taste Awful** indicates a hacked account.
As the achievement is only available through hacking in cookies. No matter **how many**

Buffs tagged with **TODO** are not done yet. It takes me less than an hour to hack each save.
So if you see an unfinished buff, won't take long!

### "How do I hack Cookie Clicker?"
You can do anything, from **save editors** (**Coderpatsy** is a very reliable **save editor**) to screwing with code.
I do literally **anything** in order to get something done quick.
On **bad days** I use a **save editor**, and on **good days** I use other means.

### So you could consider it "Not really hacking"
But it's still cheating... so, cheated saves if you will.

### If a buff is TODO for too long
As most of you know, when something is tagged as **TODO**,
It is unfinished.

And that's the same with **buffs**
But hacking them takes under **24 hours**.
But see the **wiki** for more info, because sometimes that's not the case.







That's all I have to say.

So
of course

### Todaloo


                                        Enjoy the hacked saves.
                                        If anything happens to them
                                        make sure to report it in
                                        an issue.
